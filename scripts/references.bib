	abstract = {Assessing between-study variability in the context of conventional random-effects meta-analysis is notoriously diffcult when incorporating data from only a small number of historical studies. In order to borrow strength, historical and current data are often assumed to be fully homogeneous, but this can have drastic consequences for power and Type I error if the historical information is biased. In this paper, we propose empirical and fully Bayesian modifications of the commensurate prior model (Hobbs et al. 2011) extending Pocock (1976), and evaluate their frequentist and Bayesian properties for incorporating patient-level historical data using general and generalized linear mixed regression models. Our proposed commensurate prior models lead to preposterior admissible estimators that facilitate alternative bias-variance trade-offs than those offered by pre-existing methodologies for incorporating historical data from a small number of historical studies. We also provide a sample analysis of a colon cancer trial comparing time-to-disease progression using a Weibull regression model.},

  abstract  = "The aim of this study was to develop a population
               pharmacokinetic model of sufentanil and to assess the influence
               of covariates in critically ill children admitted to a pediatric
               intensive care unit. After institutional approval, 41 children
               were enrolled in the study. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic
               (PK) assessment were collected from routinely placed arterial
               catheters during and after discontinuation of infusion.
               Population nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was performed using
               NONMEM. A 2-compartment model described sufentanil PK
               sufficiently. Typical values of the central and peripheral
               volume of distribution and the metabolic and intercompartmental
               clearance for a theoretical patient weighing 70 kg were VC =
               7.90 l, VT = 481 L, Cl = 5.3 L/h, and Q = 38.3 L/h,
               respectively. High interindividual variability of all PK
               parameters was noted. Allometric/isometric principles to scale
               sufentanil PK revealed that to achieve the same steady-state
               sufentanil concentrations in plasma for pediatric patients of
               different body weights, the infusion rate should follow the
               formula (infusion rate for a 70-kg adult patient, $\mu$g/h)
               $\times$ (body weight/70 kg)(0.75). Severity of illness
               described by PRISM score, the monitored physiological and
               laboratory parameters, and coadministered drugs such as
               vasopressors were not found to be significant covariates.",
