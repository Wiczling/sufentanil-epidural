	abstract = {Assessing between-study variability in the context of conventional random-effects meta-analysis is notoriously diffcult when incorporating data from only a small number of historical studies. In order to borrow strength, historical and current data are often assumed to be fully homogeneous, but this can have drastic consequences for power and Type I error if the historical information is biased. In this paper, we propose empirical and fully Bayesian modifications of the commensurate prior model (Hobbs et al. 2011) extending Pocock (1976), and evaluate their frequentist and Bayesian properties for incorporating patient-level historical data using general and generalized linear mixed regression models. Our proposed commensurate prior models lead to preposterior admissible estimators that facilitate alternative bias-variance trade-offs than those offered by pre-existing methodologies for incorporating historical data from a small number of historical studies. We also provide a sample analysis of a colon cancer trial comparing time-to-disease progression using a Weibull regression model.},

              in mid-1970s. It was introduced into clinical practice ten years
              later, gaining some popularity over the last twenty years. A
              piperidine derivative, sufentanil has been reported to be 6-10
              times more potent than fentanyl, depending on the route of
              administration; it has been registered for intravenous, epidural
              and subarachnoid administration. Its reported off-label use has
              included intra-articular and intranasal administration; moreover,
              it has been applied as an adjunct in peripheral blocks. In the
              review, contemporary uses of sufentanil, together with detailed
              pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are presented. The author
              concludes that the limited side effects of sufentanil, together

  abstract  = "UNLABELLED: The extent to which epidurally administered
               sufentanil acts directly on spinal opioid receptors remains
               controversial. We tested the hypothesis that small-dose boluses
               of sufentanil, given epidurally or IV, provide comparable
               analgesia at similar plasma sufentanil concentrations. The
               lipophilicity of sufentanil makes it likely to be absorbed into
               fat surrounding the epidural space. We therefore also tested the
               hypothesis that more epidural than IV sufentanil is required to
               produce comparable analgesia. Analgesia and plasma sufentanil
               concentrations were evaluated in 20 postoperative patients
               randomly assigned to patient-controlled epidural or IV
               sufentanil. Pain was evaluated with visual analog scales by
               blinded observers. Sufentanil doses and plasma concentrations
               were measured. Analgesia was similar with epidural and IV
               sufentanil administration. Plasma sufentanil concentrations were
               virtually identical in the two groups. However, significantly
               larger sufentanil doses were required with epidural
               administration: 238 +/- 50 microg vs 160 +/- 32 microg (P <
               0.01). The primary mechanism by which small-dose boluses of
               epidurally-administered sufentanil produce analgesia seems to be
               systemic absorption of the drug with subsequent recirculation to
               the supraspinal opioid receptors. This study demonstrates that
               the cumulative dose of sufentanil, when administered as a small
               epidural bolus, is approximately 50\% more than that
               administered IV to provide comparable analgesia. This indicates
               that the bioavailability of epidurally-administered sufentanil
               is reduced and suggests that a large proportion of the drug may
               be absorbed into the epidural fat. IMPLICATIONS: More epidural
               than IV sufentanil was required to provide comparable
               postoperative pain relief and similar plasma sufentanil
               concentrations. These data suggest that when sufentanil is
               administered in small-dose boluses, much of the drug is absorbed
               into the epidural fat and that the primary mechanism by which
               epidurally administered sufentanil produces analgesia is via
               systemic absorption.",

               infants receiving 0.2\% ropivacaine with sufentanil as a
               continuous epidural infusion for postoperative pain relief.
               METHODS: With consent of local ethics committee and informed
               parental consent, 20 infants 3-36 months old (m.o.) (median 9.3
               m.o., 9.0 [3.5-15] kg, ASA PS I/II) were enrolled. Epidural
               catheter was placed under general anesthesia in L3-L4, L4-L5, or
               L2-L3 interspace and threaded not farther than 4 cm into
               epidural space. After initial bolus of 0.2\% ropivacaine, 0.5
               ml¬∑kg(-1) and sufentanil 200 ng¬∑kg(-1) , continuous infusion of
               0.2\% ropivacaine, 0.3 mg¬∑kg(-1) ¬∑h(-1) with sufentanil 112
               ng¬∑kg(-1) ¬∑h(-1) was started. For the postoperative period,
               sufentanil dose was reduced to 37 ng¬∑kg(-1) ¬∑h(-1) . Blood
               samples were drawn at the end of surgery, 24 h later, by the end
               of 2nd day of infusion and after 3, 6, and 18 h from the end of
               infusion. Sufentanil was measured using liquid-liquid extraction
               (LLE) procedure and HPLC-MS/MS method with LOQ = 5 pg¬∑ml(-1) .
               RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Elimination of sufentanil following
               epidural administration was very slow, with MRT = 28.25
               [18.36-44.75] h and t1/2 MRT = 19.57 [12.72-31.01] h. In
               infants, during a long-term infusion of sufentanil with
               ropivacaine, the opioid concentration in plasma increases during
               the postoperative infusion itself, then increases even further
               after discontinuation of the infusion, in some cases reaching
               the values consistent with a potential risk of respiratory
               depression. Meticulous monitoring of the infants' vital signs is
               therefore mandatory not only during the infusion, but also for
               several hours after its discontinuation.",

               sufentanil creates a stable hemodynamic environment in
               cardiovascularly compromised pediatric patients. Clearance,
               expressed as per kilogram, is increased in children compared to
               adults. The P450 CYP3A4 enzyme is responsible for the major
               metabolic N-dealkylation pathway. Enzyme activity is reduced in
               neonates but the maturation of sufentanil clearance is not
               described. The free active fraction is affected by age because
               of the reduced $\alpha$(1) -acid glycoprotein plasma
               concentrations in neonates. Intranasal administration of
               sufentanil is a possible option for premedication, procedural
               sedation and analgesia in children, as this option has been
               found to be safe and effective. Studies concerning the
               pharmacokinetics and dynamics of sufentanil administered as a
               bolus or continuous infusion in children are few.",
